#  Fetching Posts
    ## In this section, we followed the following steps:
    
        1 - We created a file in the utils folder for storing constants and URLs that
        will be required when we will fetch the data.
        
        2 - Then we implemented the custom fetch function for fetching data
        from the APIs. It has 2 parameters body and customConfig.
        
        3 - Here we used the try and catch method so that the app doesn’t crash
        when an error is encountered.
        
        4 - We have used async-await syntax here with fetch.
        
        5 - An async function starts a request and returns a promise. When
        the request completes, the promise is resolved with the
        Response object. If the request fails, the promise is rejected.
        
        6 - The await keyword causes the JavaScript runtime to pause your
        code on this line, not allowing further code to execute in the
        meantime until the async function call has returned its result —
        very useful if subsequent code relies on that result! Therefore,
        the await keyword is used before the fetch function.
        
        7 - Since the body is an object and an object can’t be passed in fetch
        function. So, if it is present it is first converted into a string and then
        passed through the fetch function.
        
        8 - The response received is then converted into JSON format by using
        json() method.
        
        9 - If it is a success then data in JSON format is returned otherwise an error
        is returned.
        
        10 - For styling, we used CSS modules in which class names are scoped
        locally for avoiding naming conflicts.
        
# Jwt Token: 
  
    JSON Web Token is a proposed Internet standard for creating
    data with optional signature and/or optional paid encryption that keeps JSON
    validating a certain number of claims. Tokens are signed using a private
    secret or public/private key.
    
    ### The scenarios when we can use jwt token:
    
    ## Authorization: 
    This is the most important scenario where jwt token is
    used. It helps to persist the user and once the user is logged in, the jwt
    request will include all the resources, accesses that are permitted to
    the user.
    
    ## Information Exchange: 
    Jwt tokens is a good way to exchange
    information between two parties. It also helps us to check whether the
    content tampered with during transmission or not.
    The JWT access token is only valid for a finite period of time. Using an
    expired JWT will cause operations to fail. This value is normally 1200 seconds
    or 20 minutes.
    
    ## Jwt decode: 
    This is a small browser library that helps to decode jwt token
    which is encoded.
    
    ## Command to install: `npm install jwt-decode`
